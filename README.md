# Watermark Docker Base Image

This is the base image for all of Watermark's Docker images. It installs
the lowest common denominator of tools and libraries needed for all
other images. It is based on the official `centos` repository's centos7
branch. It installs essential build libraries and a handful of common
tools (e.g. vim, curl, etc.)
